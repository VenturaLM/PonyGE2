def get_labels_prob(labels):
    """
    Get the probabilities of each label in labels set.

    Parameters
    ----------
    - labels: Series composed by the elements of the dataset that satisfy a set of rules.

    Returns
    -------
    - probs: Dictionary with the following structure:

        - Value --> Probability associated to the label[i]
    - n_labels: Dictionary with the following structure:
        - Key --> Label[i]
        - Value --> Amount of i labels
